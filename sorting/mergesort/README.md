Mergesort
=========

Key Idea
--------
Mergesort is a [divide and conquer]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm")
algorithm and uses comparison based sorting. It has O(n log n) runtime.
It has two implementations :
* Top-down implementation
* Bottom-up implementation


Description
-----------
This sorting method uses following concepts:
1. If a list is empty or it contains only one element, then the list is already
   sorted. A list that contains only one element is also called singleton.
2. It uses 'Divide and Conquer' technique to recursively divide the list into
   sub-lists until it is left with either empty or singleton lists.
3. Finally, repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is
   only 1 sublist remaining which will be a sorted list.

>Note:
>* The merge opertation is a time consuming and slow operation.
 * During the merging process, a situation may arise when we run out of
   elements in one of the lists. We must, hence stop the merging process and
   copy rest of the elements from unfinished list into the final list.
Running Times
-------------
O(n Log n)

* Worst-cast performance - O(n log n)
* Average-case performance - O(n log n)
* Best-case performance - O(n log n) - typical and O(n) [natural
  variant][natural_variant]

  [natural_variant]: A natural merge sort is similar to a bottom up merge sort except
  that any naturally occurring runs (sorted sequences) in the input are exploited.
